# What This Is

A group project between friends to get practice creating new apps from scratch as a distributed team. Our team hails from Norway, Texas, Chicago, and California.

## Quick! Elevator pitch

An app that allows users to search for recipes they want to make, and then find someone to make it with live on video.

## Run it!

1. Clone this repo

2. Change directory to \recipe-app, install the dependencies, and start the development server.

   ```
   > cd groupProject\frontend\recipe-app
   > npm i
   > npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to localhost:3000 (which should open automatically)
